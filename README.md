# Poodle-computer-network
Poodle is a C project that models a computer network as a graph with security-constrained nodes and weighted edges. It uses graph traversal and shortest-path techniques (BFS, Dijkstra-style) to validate paths, choose optimal source nodes, compute minimum-time propagation plans, and handle state changes like security level upgrades during traversal.
